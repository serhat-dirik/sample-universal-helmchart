Your {{.Chart.Name }} chart has been successfully deployed.

Your application is running and can be accessed via the following methods:

{{- if include "universal-chart.isOpenShift". }}
NOTE: Deployed on an OpenShift cluster.

An OpenShift Route has been created to expose your service. You can get the URL by running:

  export ROUTE_URL=$(oc get route {{ include "universal-chart.fullname". }} -n {{.Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
  echo "Access your application at: http://$ROUTE_URL"

A Role and RoleBinding have also been created to grant the application's ServiceAccount
permission to use the 'anyuid' Security Context Constraint. This allows the container
to run with the user ID specified in its Dockerfile.
{{- else }}
NOTE: Deployed on a standard Kubernetes cluster.

An Ingress resource has been created to expose your service. To get the address, run:

  kubectl get ingress {{ include "universal-chart.fullname". }} --namespace {{.Release.Namespace }}

It may take a few minutes for the Ingress controller to assign an external IP.
{{- end }}

To see the logs from your application and verify its UID, run the following commands:

1. Get the pod name:
   export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{.Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance={{.Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items.metadata.name}")

2. Tail the logs:
   kubectl logs $POD_NAME --namespace {{.Release.Namespace }} --follow

You should see messages indicating the application is running as UID 1001.
